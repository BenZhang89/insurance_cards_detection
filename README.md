# insurance_cards_detection

# Built a model to crop, rotate and label the bounding box of member IDs for 51 type of scanned insurance cards. Used transfer learning(VGG16) to classify the cards and achieved 99% accuracy. Then built a Recurrent Attention -CNN model to localize the member IDs and applied customized OCR to extract the member IDs, got 92% accuracy. Deploying this model on AWS and putting it into application for NYU Langone.
